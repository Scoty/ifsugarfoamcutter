---

## 🚀 Features

- Convert `.tap` files to `.gcode` automatically
- Select **feed rate** and **power** via a clean Compose UI
- Preview the generated file
- Built using **Kotlin 2.2.10** and **Compose Multiplatform 1.8.2**
- Cross-platform packaging: Windows `.msi` and macOS `.dmg`

## 📦 Packaging (Distributables)

Compose Multiplatform supports building native installers.

### 🪟 Windows – Create `.msi`

```bash
./gradlew packageMsi
```

This generates an MSI installer at:

```
composeApp/build/compose/binaries/main-release/msi/
```

### 🍏 macOS – Create `.dmg`

```bash
./gradlew packageDmg
```

This generates a DMG installer at:

```

You can also build both in one command:

```bash
./gradlew package
```
